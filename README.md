## Hi, I’m Manas 👋  
A Computer Science undergraduate. I like building systems that evolve from simple ideas into more realistic architectures.
I usually start with a naive implementation, let it break, and then redesign it to handle the issues as I move on.
I learn best by building and observing *why* real systems need queues, background workers, and event-driven flows.
