## Hi, I’m Manas 👋  
A Computer Science undergraduate. I like building systems that evolve from simple ideas into more realistic architectures.
I usually start with a naive implementation, let it break, and then redesign it to handle:

- Asynchronous workflows  
- State transitions and consistency  
- Failure recovery and retries  
- Coordination between independent components  

I learn best by building and observing *why* real systems need queues, background workers, and event-driven flows.
